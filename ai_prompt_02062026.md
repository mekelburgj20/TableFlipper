 Read the @checkpoint.md and the @README.md to get acquainted with the project. My session was cut off unexpectedly before I could update the checkpoint or readme. We were working on the following additions to the project goals: NOTE: I will use the terms 'table' and 'game' interchangeably. 
 1. The Daily Grind tournaments (DG) run daily from 12:01am Central to 12:00am Central the following day (24 hours). At 12am Central each morning, the TableFlipper app should perform a scheduled maintenance and winner announcement. First, the next DG table should be unlocked. You will know the next DG table because it will be the only table in the list of games that has the text 'DG' in the name and is currently locked. Then you should lock the DG table that just ended in iscored.info so no more scores can be submitted. Then, the winner of the now locked table that just ended should be announced in the Discord Daily Grind channel. Included in the announcement should be a message that says something like, "Congratulations %PlayerName%, you've won the Daily Grind! Please pick the next table by using the /picktable command." We need to make sure that the only person that can pick this table is the person (Discord ID?) that won the DG that just ended. There is a Dynasty rule that doesn't allow the same winner to pick twice in a row, so for this we need logic that allows the consecutive winner to 'nominate' a table picker. We need logic to make sure the only person allowed to pick is this nomiated winner. We also need logic that if no winner or nomiated table picker responds within 12 hours, a predetermined table is selected at random from a list of predetermined tables. Just to reiterate, the DG schedule should be yesterday's DG winner has picked a table that we will play in 48 hours. The previous DG winner to that persons has picked the table we are playing today. The winner of today's DG will pick the table not for tomorrow but for the following day. There will always be a day buffer in between winner and pick so that people have enough time to pick a table and one is already queued up.
 2. We need the ability to pause table picking for the day. This is because sometimes a new table is released and everyone will want to play that for the DG instead of the winner's pick. This can be initiated by a Discord Mod via slash command - something like /pause-dg-pick. This process should still allow the winner of the last DG to pick a table or nominate, but the start date of that table should be advanced 24 hours further.
 3. We need an easy slash command to announce the current standings - displayed to only the person who did the slash command. Maybe /current-dg-scores.
 4. Change slash command name '/myscore-dg' to '/submitscore-dg'.
 5. I want a way to list all available tables to pick from to be displayed to any user via slash command. Something like '/dg-table-selection'. This will pull from a maintained google sheet. There may be multiple tabs inside this sheet so we will need to indicate which tab has the full table selection.
 6. I want to keep track of the tables played, the winners, the scores, the date the DG was active. This can be maintained however you see fit but I'd like to be able to use the data to build a report or search through. Like, find out who has won the most tables in a given period. Or how many times we've plated a certain table. Or what the highest score earned on table has been. This is low priority so can be the last thing we do. 
 7. There are also various forms of a weekly grind with a similar logic, except the time runs from week to week, starting on Wednesday's at 12:01am Central. The weekly grinds have  multiple forms though. There is a wg-vpxs and a wg-vr. There is also a monthly grind called 'mg-realpin'. This will start on the first of the month and end on the last of the month. I need all the same logic and flow applied to these with their associated slash commands. All of the tables will be tracked in the same iscored.info 'game room', with designations added to each game name like Daily Grind has 'DG', wg-vpxs will have 'WG-VPXS', and wg-vr will have 'WG-VR'. Monthly grind will have just 'MG' in it.
