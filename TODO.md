1. [COMPLETED] I want this to all be version controlled in the git repo (Github) that it's in now. So after we make significant changes, we need to commit to a feature branch. Offer best practice for how to do PRs for this. Should you commit directly to main or use a feature branch and once we agree everything looks good, we do a PR to Main branch? Currently nothing has been merged to main in the Github repo so let's start there.
2. [COMPLETED] The Daily Grind table in iScored will only be active for a day. To remind you, the winner of a Daily Grind will pick a table for the Daily Grind Tournament occurring 24 hours after the end of the just won DG. This gives a 24 hour buffer for the winner of the just ended DG a full day to pick a table and allows an already picked and queued up table to be active immediately after the just ended DG is locked. Please ask if you don't understand this. That logic should already be working. Here's what I'd like to change... The table that is queued up but not yet active, I want this to be hidden, not locked. This way it doesn't clutter up the scoreboard with a table that can't have scores submitted to it yet. Once it is ready to become active, we need to just un-hide it.3. [COMPLETED] We keep track of all the winners historically. Currently this is in a spreadsheet saved on a google drive. I'd like to start storing these in a lightweight database of some sort. I'd like to be able to run reports against this for things like "Show who won the daily grind on 1/1/2026 and what their score was". 
4. [COMPLETED] What if someone names a Table wrong during the /picktable command? Then a mod goes in and manually fixes it in iscored. Will this cause a problem with posting scores, locking the table, etc? I wonder if there's a better way to pick tables that prevents error. I'm thinking of having all the tables that you can possibly pick in a database (lightweight). Then during the table pick command /picktable, the 'table-name' provides options to pick from that is error validated so they can't get it wrong. 
   - Implemented `tables` table in SQLite with platform flags (`is_atgames`, `is_wg_vr`, `is_wg_vpxs`).
   - Added `npm run sync-tables` to load data from the Google Sheet.
   - Updated `/picktable` with Autocomplete and strict filtering logic for DG, WG-VR, and WG-VPXS.
   - Monthly Grind (MG) remains flexible (no filtering). 
5. We need persistent logging for troubleshooting inspection in case issues arise. 

Future Considerations
1. I'm wondering if there's a way for us to maintain a database of all the tables we want available for players to choose from and associate them with a 'Community Style' which iScored currently maintains. As an example of this style that gets applied, here's the outerHTML of one of the styles you can select when creating a new game: <tr onclick="loadStylePreview(2924)" role="row" class="odd rowSelected"><td style="font-weight: bold" class="sorting_1">007</td><td style="font-style: italic"> </td><td>Psw757</td></tr>  . The key there being 'loadStylePreview(2924). I want to investigate (not implement) a possible method of associating the available tables (not yet loaded in to the database) with a Community Style. If we could try to apply the 24 style (loadStylePreview(2924)), to a new game we can call 'Test Game', then we could manually find all the community styles we want for each game, and load them in to the database via csv import or something. Then when the app creates a new game for the Daily Grind, Weekly, etc., it can look up the game in the database and see what style is associated that we want to use. If this doesn't work out or is too complex, I would like to instead have a default style that we can apply to each game created. Then a human mod can come in later and apply the appropriate style manually. 
2. For Picker Time out, I think a Moderator/admin should be able to /nominate someone else to pick, in the event that the winner of an event doesn't respond and we don't want a random table chosen. So before the picker timeout occurs, a mod/admin should be able to run /nominate-picker and select anyone. Then that nominee has until the picker timeout to choose.
3. We need the option to define what Discord Channel specific bot functions work in. I have the following channels: 'daily-grind', 'wg-vpxs', 'wg-vr', and 'mg-realpin'. The 'mg-realpin' is the Monthly Grind for IRL Pinball. The others are self explanitory. So the /tablepicker command should work in all those channels, however if there is a simple way to limit /picktable functionality per channel to only allow and display tables relevant to each channel, that would be ideal. Then we could eliminate the /picktable parameter 'game-type', as that would default to the channel the /picktable command was issued in.
