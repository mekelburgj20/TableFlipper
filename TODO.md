1. [COMPLETED] I want this to all be version controlled in the git repo (Github) that it's in now. So after we make significant changes, we need to commit to a feature branch. Offer best practice for how to do PRs for this. Should you commit directly to main or use a feature branch and once we agree everything looks good, we do a PR to Main branch? Currently nothing has been merged to main in the Github repo so let's start there.
2. [COMPLETED] The Daily Grind table in iScored will only be active for a day. To remind you, the winner of a Daily Grind will pick a table for the Daily Grind Tournament occurring 24 hours after the end of the just won DG. This gives a 24 hour buffer for the winner of the just ended DG a full day to pick a table and allows an already picked and queued up table to be active immediately after the just ended DG is locked. Please ask if you don't understand this. That logic should already be working. Here's what I'd like to change... The table that is queued up but not yet active, I want this to be hidden, not locked. This way it doesn't clutter up the scoreboard with a table that can't have scores submitted to it yet. Once it is ready to become active, we need to just un-hide it.3. We keep track of all the winners historically. Currently this is in a spreadsheet saved on a google drive. I'd like to start storing these in a lightweight database of some sort. I'd like to be able to run reports against this for things like "Show who won the daily grind on 1/1/2026 and what their score was". 
4. What if someone names a Table wrong during the /picktable command? Then a mod goes in and manually fixes it in iscored. Will this cause a problem with posting scores, locking the table, etc? I wonder if there's a better way to pick tables that prevents error. I'm thinking of having all the tables that you can possibly pick in a database (lightweight). Then during the table pick command /picktable, the 'table-name' provides options to pick from that is error validated so they can't get it wrong.
