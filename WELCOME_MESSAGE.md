# 👋 Welcome to the TableFlipper Beta!

**What is this?**
TableFlipper is our new robot butler 🤖 for the pinball league! It automatically handles all the boring stuff: setting up tournaments on iScored, locking games when they finish, announcing winners, and tracking who gets to pick the next table.

**Why do we need it?**
To make our lives easier! No more waiting for admins to unlock games or fix manual errors. It keeps everything running smoothly 24/7.

**How YOU can help:**
We need you to try and break it! 💥 Please try these out in order:

### 1. 🏆 Submit a Score
Play a game and submit your score directly through Discord.
*   Type `/submit-score`.
*   Enter your score, attach a pic, and put in your initials.
*   *The bot will post it to iScored for you!*

### 2. 🏅 Check Winners
Check back tomorrow (or after a maintenance cycle) to see who won!
*   Type `/list-winners` to see the leaderboard.
*   *Note: I'll be manually forcing the Weekly Grinds to end in a few days so we can test the rollover.*

### 3. 🎱 Pick a Table (If you win!)
If you win a Daily/Weekly grind, you get to pick the next one.
*   Type `/picktable` and choose a grind type.
*   Start typing a table name (like "Addams") and pick from the list.
*   **Fun Mode:** Pick the `surprise-me: True` option to let the bot choose a random table for you!

### 4. 📜 See the Available Tables
Want to see every allowed table for future picks?
*   Type `/dg-table-selection`.
*   It will show you a massive list that **only you** can see.
