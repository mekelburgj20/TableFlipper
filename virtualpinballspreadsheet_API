API
VPS is open source and hosted completely on github. Our "database" consists of one json file that is exposed publicly. Images are hosted on github aswell and exposed to the public. The URLs to the respective images is listed in the database json.

If you want to use the database in your own application you can fetch it through this url:

https://virtualpinballspreadsheet.github.io/vps-db/db/vpsdb.json
The database is rebuilt regulary on every change. If you want to save on excess calls you can fetch this file first to get the timestamp of the latest release:

https://virtualpinballspreadsheet.github.io/vps-db/lastUpdated.json
If your version is outdated, you might fetch the latest.

With every update, a full new pupLookup.csv is generated aswell in case you want to update yours on a regular basis.
